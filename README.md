## Introduction
A prophecy is being chanted by those blessed with the Sight. The coming of new dark rulers is being foretold, and you will ensure the prophecy comes to pass.

### What You Do
In Dark Prophecy you will:
 - Choose Dark Deeds to complete to ensure the Prophecy comes to pass
 - Play cards to advance your Dark Deeds

### Start Play
Randomly select the first player then begin Round 1.

# How To Play
<!-- tags:"rounds,turns" -->
Dark Prophecy is played over a series of *Rounds*. Each Round consists of each player taking a *Turn*.

## Start of the Round
Reveal any facedown Prophecy cards in the Prophecy Row.

## On Your Turn
Your turn is divided into three phases:

 - **Action Phase**: Take up to 2 actions.
 - **Prophecy Phase**: Read the revealed Prophecy Verses and gain their benefits
 - **End of Turn**: Draw up to your hand size. Default 5 cards.

### Action Phase
During your Action Phase you may take up to 2 actions. You do not have to use all your actions. You may perform the following actions in any order. You may perform each action more than once. The actions are listed here and detailed below:

 - Play a Card
 - Level Up a Discipline
 - Scheme

#### Play a Card
Play any card from you hand and follow its instructions. Follow all instructions in the main description of the card, sentence by sentence. Fully resolve any effects of the card for each sentence. The card you play is always discarded last.

Some cards will have a **Discipline Bonus** at the bottom of the card, as well as its requirement. If your level in the card's associated Discipline meets or exceeds that requirement, you may also perform the Bonus. Some Bonuses will modify the main effect of the card instead of performing an extra effect.

#### Level Up a Discipline
Once per Discipline per turn, you may discard one card whose power meets or exceeds your Discipline's current level. Increase that Discipline's level by 1 by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. If the Discipline was at level 3, instead flip it over to level 4.

The Discipline of the card discarded does *not* need to match the Discipline you are leveling up. You may *not* discard more than one card to level up a Discipline.

>**Example**
>Tinnifer has Blood Magic of level 0. She discards a card of Power 2, then rotates her Blood Magic 90 degrees, making it level 1.
